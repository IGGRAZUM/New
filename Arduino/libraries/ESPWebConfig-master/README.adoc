= WebConfig Class for ESP8266 =

With this class you can easily have a generic web configurator for
the transceiver, where you can change between Access Point and Station
modes at any time without needing to rewire the module.

Even when it is configured to work as a Station, if it fails to connect
to the wifi router it will fallback automatically to AP mode, so you
still can access your module from the web.

On the very first run, it will start in AP mode on 192.168.0.1
From there, you can use any browser to configure the module.

This code is to be compiled with Arduino IDE + ESP8266 Board Extension.
